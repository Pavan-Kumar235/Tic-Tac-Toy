# Tic-Tac-Toy
This project is an interactive and engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game built as part of my internship. The application allows two players to compete against each other. It includes functions for handling user clicks, tracking the game state, and checking for winning conditions. Additionally, it features responsive design across different devices.
